An open source project for creating your own cross-platform game engines with MonoGame Framework.  Instead of starting completely from scratch, this project will provide you with sample engines, code snippets, demo games, and tutorials to get you up and running a lot faster.  All code may be used commercially without licensing fees, so it's perfect for indie developers. 

#Name
The acronym RYOGE doesn't really roll off the tongue and is too hard to remember.  So we nicknamed the project Ruge, pronounced like "rouge" or "rogue" (your preference).

#Why roll your own engine for your games?

* only include code in your engine that you're actually using for your specific game
* innovate with your own unique gameplay ideas
* streamline your workflow to maximize creativity by catering to the way you want to work for your specific type of game 
* better branding for your indie gaming company; use your own name and logos
* makes you a better developer
* satisfies your inner control freak
* bragging rights ;)

#Project Milestones

* Sample game engines with demo games.  Initially the focus will be on a playing/trading card engine and a 2.5d RPG engine.
* Code repository with lots of example code you can copy and paste into your project to add specific features to your game
* Initially we will focus on desktop platforms (Windows/Linux/Mac) until the project is sufficiently established.  Mobile and console will come later when desktop is stable/mature
